# approximationTheory
A collection of miscellaneous things from approximation theory and harmonic analysis including Fejer and Dirichlet Kernels, Lagrange interpolation,Chebyshev nodes, interpolation from trigonometric polynomials.I also show how to approximate the modulus of continuity both stochastically and deterministically. There are also animations that illustrate the convergence of fourier series, however as of now these animation do not properly render on github, but should render in a local jupyter notebook.
