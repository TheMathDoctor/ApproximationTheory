# approximationTheory
A collection of miscellaneous things from approximation theory and harmonic analysis including Fejer and Dirichlet Kernels, Lagrange interpolation,Chebyshev nodes, convoluation operators, interpolation from trigonometric polynomials.I also show how to approximate the modulus of continuity both stochastically and deterministically. There are also animations that illustrate the convergence of fourier series, however as of now these animation do not properly render on github, but should work in a local jupyter notebook. Do note that this project was meant as a visualization tool for studying for my comprehensive exams in the mentioned subjects and is therefore not necessarily optimized or presented in any logical order.
